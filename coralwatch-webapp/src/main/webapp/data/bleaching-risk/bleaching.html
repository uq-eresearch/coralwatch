<h2 style="margin-top:0px;">Surveys with a potential bleaching risk</h2>
<p>
Through a validation analysis that compared 10 years of our data to well-established
bleaching events, CoralWatch has developed an evidence-based approach to classifying our data.
Based on our analyses, each of the surveys listed below has a 70% likelihood of representing
a small bleaching event. Read more about our validation analysis

<p>
If you see a survey in your area indicating a potential bleaching risk, please conduct additional
CoralWatch surveys, or inform your local reef management group so additional investigations can
be carried out to determine if a true bleaching event is occurring.</p>
