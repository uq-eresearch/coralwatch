<h2 style="margin-top:0px;">Surveys with a potential bleaching risk</h2>
<p>
CoralWatch has conducted statistical analysis comparing 10 years of our data to what is known
about well-established bleaching events. This validation analysis has allowed us to develop a
new evidence-based approach to classifying our data. Surveys which indicate a potential risk of
bleaching are listed below. If a single survey indicates a 'potential bleaching risk', this does not
mean that bleaching is definitely occurring. Based on our analyses, each of the surveys listed
below has a 70% likelihood of representing a small bleaching event. More than one survey is
necessary to confirm a bleaching event. If multiple surveys from the same region indicate
potential bleaching risk, then this increases the likelihood that a true bleaching event is occurring.

If you see a survey in your area indicating a potential bleaching risk, please conduct an additional
CoralWatch survey if possible, or inform your local reef management group to allow them to
conduct additional investigations.<p>
