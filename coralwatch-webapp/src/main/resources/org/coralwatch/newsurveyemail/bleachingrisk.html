        Dear CoralWatcher,
    </p>
    <br>

    <p>
        Thank you for contributing to the CoralWatch global database.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your survey has been classified as a ‘potential bleaching risk’. This indicates that, based on several selection criteria applied to your uploaded data, the hard coral community monitored by you is light in colour and shows a potential bleaching risk.</br>
        <a href="<baseurl>/survey?p_p_id=surveyportlet_WAR_coralwatch&_surveyportlet_WAR_coralwatch_cmd=view&_surveyportlet_WAR_coralwatch_surveyId=<surveyid>">Review your survey here.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        This alone does not mean a bleaching event is occurring. What you can do now:
    </p>
    <ul style="padding-left: 30px;">
        <li>Conduct additional CoralWatch surveys in the same area to confirm if a bleaching event is occurring</li>
        <li>Contact your local reef management group to allow them to conduct further investigations</li>
        <li>Spread the word – inspire others to help monitor your reefs (e.g. Facebook, Twitter)</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <p>
        Please keep up the good work and continue to share the message about the importance of conserving reefs with your friends and networks.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
        Best wishes,
    </p>
    <p>
        The CoralWatch team
