Dear CoralWatcher,<br>

<p>
Thank you for contributing to the CoralWatch global database.
</p>

<p>
Your survey has been classified as a ‘potential bleaching risk’.
This indicates that, based on statistical analyses, your survey has a 70% likelihood of
representing a small bleaching event.
</p>

<p>
This alone does not mean a bleaching event is occurring.  What you can do now:
<ul>
<li>Conduct additional CoralWatch surveys to confirm if a bleaching event is occurring</li>
<li>Contact your local reef management group to allow them to conduct further investigations</li>
<li>Spread the word – inspire others to help monitor your reefs (e.g. Facebook, twitter)</li>
</ul> 
</p>

<p>
Please keep up the good work and continue to share the message about the importance of conserving reefs with your friends and networks.  
</p>

<br>
Best wishes,<br>
The CoralWatch Team<br>
